## Markdown Basics
---  

[Markdown](markdown) allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub

-- 

### Basic writing

---  

##### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

    On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.
     
    On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles.

##### Headings

You can create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

    # The largest heading (an <h1> tag)
    ## The second largest heading (an <h2> tag)
    â€¦
    ###### The 6th largest heading (an <h6> tag)

--  

##### Blockquotes

    You can indicate [blockquotes](bq) with a `>`.
    
    In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

    > Pardon my french
    
--  

##### Styling text

You can make text **[bold](b)** or *[italic](i)*.

    *This text will be italic*
    **This text will be bold**

Both **bold** and *italic* can use either a `*` or an `_` around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.

    **Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**
