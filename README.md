## Markdown Basics

[Markdown](markdown) allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub

### Basic writing

##### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

    On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.
     
    On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles.

##### Headings

You can create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.
